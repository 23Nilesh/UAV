# UAUV(Unmanned Aerial-UnderWater Vehicle) or Amphibious Drone
## Attitude control of amphibious drone 
Hybrid Drones, or Unmanned Aerial and Underwater Vehicles (UAUVs), are aircraft that do not 
require a human pilot on board and are controlled either by humans from a distant location or by 
computers on board. Initially, we developed aerial drones & were designed for military uses, but 
now drones have seen significant advancements and are now multifunctional instruments used in 
several industries, such as agriculture, surveillance in both air and underwater, filmmaking, 
disaster response, and other fields. These UAUV vehicles are outfitted with various sensors, 
cameras, and other specialised equipment, allowing them to acquire detailed pictures, monitor 
changes in the environment, and perform particular tasks with minimum human involvement.

In this project, first, we tried to control the drone in aerial environments using different 
controllers(PID, SMC, Fuzzy Logic SMC) and compared their performances based on the results. 
We have tried to make an 8-shape trajectory which is crucial in drone navigation. The project uses 
Matlab/Simulink, incorporating mathematical modelling and simulations to analyze drone 
behaviour. After this, we modelled it in Simscape for physical simulations.
